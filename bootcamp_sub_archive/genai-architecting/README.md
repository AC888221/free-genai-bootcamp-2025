## Scenario Context
- This project focuses on a Putonghua (Simplified Chinese) Language Learning School located in Melbourne.
- The school aims to serve a diverse student base reflective of the local community.
- With a minimal budget, the school plans to explore free or low-cost AI tools to support the development of language learning applications and prototype learning apps.
- The school currently has 2000 active students primarily located across the City of Monash, Melbourne, with a mix of Putonghua-speaking and non-Putonghua-speaking families.

## Business Requirements
Enhance Accessibility and Flexibility
- Objective: Provide additional learning opportunities that cater to diverse learning preferences, accommodate busy schedules, and address lack of opportunity to practice with fluent Putonghua speakers.
- Goal: Increase student participation and retention by removing barriers such as location, time constraints, and limited language exposure outside the classroom.

## Functional Requirements
- The platform should integrate cost-effective AI tools, prioritizing open-source models where possible.
- The platform must support students from varied linguistic backgrounds, including both Putonghua-speaking and non-Putonghua-speaking families.

## Assumptions
- Open-source LLMs and other AI tools will meet the project's initial needs and can be run on minimal infrastructure. These tools will be selected based on affordability and compatibility with lightweight hardware, avoiding the need for significant investment in dedicated AI PCs or costly cloud services.
- The prototypes will run on existing office equipment or through cost-effective cloud services that offer free or low-cost tiers. The infrastructure for this first phase will not require large investments in servers or on-premise systems.
- This exploration and prototyping phase of the project will serve a small subset of students for testing, meaning bandwidth requirements can be managed with a single server.

## Data Strategy
- Open-source datasets and public domain content will be prioritized to minimize costs.
- Ensure that personal student data is anonymized or securely stored.
- Ensure proper licensing and permissions are obtained to avoid any legal issues.
- Only store content where absolutely necessary, and where licensing permits.
