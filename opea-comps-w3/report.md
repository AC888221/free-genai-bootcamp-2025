Initial Research and Model Selection:
Analyzed vLLM supported models with RAM requirements of 16GB or less
Created a comprehensive comparison table of 8 model architectures
Initially selected Phi3SmallForCausalLM due to its newness and lower storage requirements
Implementation Attempts:
Tried to implement vLLM with microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct model
Encountered issues requiring trust_remote_code=True flag
Switched to a smaller model (Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct) which successfully loaded in about 10 minutes
Technical Setup:
Updated docker-compose.yml to use vllm-openvino (for CPU support)
Added configuration command with trust-remote-code flag
Attempted model deployment using both Docker and pip installation methods
Tested API endpoints using curl commands
Documentation:
Created a glossary of LLM-related terms
Documented different LLM microservices (Ollama, TGI, vLLM)
Recorded implementation challenges and solutions


Initial Problem Identification:
Discovered issues with model loading and configuration
Found that the system was defaulting to GPT-2 instead of the intended Qwen model
Identified that the max_model_len setting was causing conflicts
Model Selection:
Switched to a smaller, more efficient model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
Added proper trust_remote_code support for Qwen models
Adjusted max_model_len to 1024 to match model capabilities
Configuration Improvements:
Consolidated configuration in .env file for better management
Added essential environment variables:
OpenVINO GPU support
Model quantization settings
HuggingFace token and cache settings
Long model length allowance
Docker Configuration Updates:
Removed unnecessary services (vllm-gaudi-server)
Optimized vllm-openvino-arc service for Intel GPU usage
Added proper device mappings for GPU access
Improved healthcheck configuration
Added proper environment variable passing from .env
System Requirements:
Configured for Intel integrated GPU usage
Set up proper OpenVINO backend settings
Added necessary device access permissions
The system should now be better configured for:
Lower resource usage (smaller model)
Better GPU utilization (OpenVINO optimizations)
Easier configuration management (.env file)
More reliable startup and operation


Here's a summary of the actions taken to set up and test the OPEA (OpenAI-based) API using the vLLM framework:
Setup and Configuration
1. Docker Compose Configuration:
Created a docker-compose.yaml file to define the services, including vllm-server, vllm-openvino, and vllm-openvino-arc.
Configured environment variables and port mappings to ensure proper operation.
Environment Variables:
Set environment variables for model configuration, including LLM_MODEL_ID, LLM_ENDPOINT_PORT, and others to customize the behavior of the services.
Service Initialization:
Started the Docker containers using Docker Compose, which pulled the necessary images and initialized the services.
Testing and Validation
4. Health Check:
Attempted to check the health of the API using curl http://localhost:8008/health, which did not return output initially.
5. API Functionality Testing:
Successfully tested the chat completion endpoint with a request for a joke, receiving a valid response.
Successfully tested the text completion endpoint with a prompt, receiving a coherent continuation of the text.
6. Log Monitoring:
Monitored logs for the vllm-openvino-arc container to identify any warnings or errors during startup and operation.
Noted deprecation warnings related to the websockets library but confirmed that they did not affect functionality.
Observations
The API is operational and responding to requests, indicating successful deployment and configuration.
The health check endpoint may require further investigation, as it did not return output despite the API functioning correctly.
Next Steps
Continue testing additional endpoints to explore the full capabilities of the API.
Investigate the health check issue further if needed.
Consider integrating the API into applications or workflows as required.


rogress Report: OPEA Integration with VLLM Service
Summary of Actions Taken
We successfully migrated the FastAPI application from using Ollama to using the VLLM service. This involved several key steps and troubleshooting efforts:
1. Initial Problem Identification
Identified that the application was encountering 404 errors when trying to access Ollama endpoints
Discovered that the environment had been updated to use VLLM instead of Ollama
2. Code Modifications
Updated environment variable references from OLLAMA_API_BASE to VLLM_API_BASE
Changed the client variable name from ollama_client to vllm_client for consistency
Modified the API endpoint from /api/generate to /v1/chat/completions to match VLLM's API structure
Updated the request payload format to conform to VLLM's expected structure
Changed service name references from "Ollama Chat Service" to "VLLM Chat Service"
Updated the default model to "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
3. Troubleshooting
Verified the health of the VLLM service using the /health endpoint
Confirmed available endpoints by checking the VLLM service logs
Identified that the VLLM service uses OpenAI-compatible endpoints (/v1/chat/completions, /v1/completions) rather than Ollama-specific endpoints (/api/generate, /api/pull)
Verified that the model "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct" was available in the VLLM service
4. Testing
Tested the FastAPI application's root endpoint to confirm it was running correctly
Attempted to make requests to the VLLM service directly to understand its API structure
Updated the testing commands to use the correct endpoints and payload format
Current Status
The FastAPI application has been successfully updated to use the VLLM service instead of Ollama. The application now:
Connects to the VLLM service running at the specified URL (default: http://localhost:8008)
Uses the OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions endpoint for generating responses
Properly formats messages in the structure expected by the VLLM service
Extracts the assistant's message from the VLLM response

Actions Taken to Fix OPEA vLLM Container Issues
Diagnosed the unhealthy container issue by examining Docker logs and identifying that the vLLM server was running but failing health checks.
Identified the root cause: The VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN was set to 1 in the .env file, causing the model to have an insufficient maximum context length of just 1 token.
Fixed YAML syntax errors in the docker-compose.yaml file by properly formatting the multi-line entrypoint command using the block scalar syntax (>).
Added improved logging to the container configuration to capture startup parameters and runtime errors.
Updated the .env file to set VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=2048, providing sufficient context length for normal operation.
Added volume mounting for logs to persist log files outside the container for easier debugging.
Adjusted health check parameters to give the container more time to initialize properly.
These changes resolved the issues with the OpenVINO-based vLLM container, allowing it to properly serve the Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model with appropriate context length.

OPEA Progress Report: Fixing vLLM OpenVINO Container Configuration
 Identified issue with vLLM OpenVINO container showing as unhealthy despite running
• Added debugging environment variables (VLLM_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG) to .env file
• Extended healthcheck timeouts to accommodate model loading time
• Added VLLM_OPENVINO_KVCACHE_SPACE setting to eliminate warnings
• Updated docker-compose.yaml to use new environment variables
• Verified container successfully loads Qwen2.5-0.5B model with int8 quantization
• Confirmed API functionality by testing /health endpoint and generating text
• Demonstrated OPEA's capability to run optimized LLMs on CPU hardware using OpenVINO
