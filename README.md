# Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025

Welcome to my Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025 project repository! This was part of a 6-week intensive online training program focused on building AI-powered language learning applications using both locally hosted and managed AI resources.

## About The Bootcamp

The bootcamp was a comprehensive program delivered through Youtube, Discord, and ExamPro, featuring:
- Project-based learning with real-world applications
- Community-driven development
- Expert instruction from industry professionals
- Hands-on experience with generative AI

## Repository Structure
