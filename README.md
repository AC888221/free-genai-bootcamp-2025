## Resetting the Git Repository

### Overview
This is my first project maintaining a Git repository, and as part of the bootcamp, the backend version control became a bit messy due to the removal of the API. To improve documentation and tracking of changes, I decided to reset the repository. This reset aims to make it easier to review the process and ensure smoother development moving forward.

This document outlines the steps I took to reset the Git repository and my rationale.

### Steps Taken to Reset Git
1. Added Back the Original lang-portal to Establish v1.0

To preserve a stable version of the code before any significant changes, I started by adding the original lang-portal back into the repository. This allowed me to establish a clean version, marking it as v1.0.

2. Replaced the backend-flask Folder

I replaced the existing backend-flask folder with a new one provided by the bootcamp, which had some APIs removed. This was done so that I could rewrite the APIs for the bootcamp's specific requirements.

3. Staged, Committed, and Pushed the Changes

After replacing the folder, I staged the changes to ensure Git tracked the deletion of the old folder and the addition of the new one. Once staged, I committed the changes locally, marking the point where the old backend was replaced with the new version. I then pushed these updates to the remote repository to synchronize it with the new version, making the changes accessible to collaborators.

4. Tagged the New Version

To mark this milestone, I tagged the new version (v2.0), allowing easy reference in the future.
