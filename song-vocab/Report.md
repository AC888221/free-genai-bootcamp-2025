5. **Interaction Methods**
   - Explained available methods to interact with the API:
     - Swagger UI interface
     - cURL commands
     - Python requests
   - Noted that this is currently a backend-only implementation

6. **Next Steps Could Include**:
   - Implementing the frontend interface
   - Adding more robust error handling
   - Implementing caching for searched songs
   - Expanding language model support beyond Phi4-mini

The project follows an Agentic Workflow by breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and providing clear documentation for each component.

Tested the /api/get_vocabulary endpoint:

We provided Chinese text to extract vocabulary words.
Initially, we encountered a JSON decode error due to incorrect formatting.
We corrected the JSON format by removing line breaks and ensuring the text was properly enclosed in double quotes.
After fixing the format, the request was successful, and we received a list of vocabulary words.
Tested the /api/agent endpoint:

We provided a song name and artist to retrieve the lyrics.
Initially, we encountered a "Field required" error because the message_request field was missing.
We added the message_request field and formatted it correctly as a string.
After fixing the format, we encountered an "Internal Server Error" due to a connection issue with Ollama.
We provided instructions to ensure Ollama is installed and running.
We added cURL commands to test the endpoints from the command line.


Summary of Actions
1. Environment Configuration:
Loading Environment Variables: Utilized python-dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file. This allowed for dynamic configuration of the ollama service URL, ensuring flexibility across different environments.
Example: Set OLLAMA_API_BASE to http://localhost:8008 in the .env file and used os.getenv to retrieve this value in the code.
2. HTTP Client Setup:
Asynchronous HTTP Requests: Implemented httpx.AsyncClient to handle asynchronous HTTP requests to the ollama service. This approach is efficient for I/O-bound operations, such as network requests.
Example: In extract_vocabulary.py, used async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url=OLLAMA_API_BASE) to make requests to the ollama API.
3. Error Handling and Logging:
Comprehensive Error Handling: Added error handling for HTTP errors and JSON decoding issues to ensure robust operation and easier debugging.
Example: Used try-except blocks to catch httpx.HTTPError and json.JSONDecodeError, logging detailed error messages for troubleshooting.
4. Code Refactoring:
Async Function Conversion: Converted the extract_vocabulary function to an asynchronous function using async def, allowing it to properly use async with for the HTTP client.
Example: Changed the function signature to async def extract_vocabulary(text: str) and ensured all call sites use await.
5. Domain Knowledge Application:
Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: Applied knowledge of Python's asynchronous programming model to refactor functions and manage asynchronous I/O operations effectively.
API Integration: Leveraged understanding of RESTful API principles to configure and interact with the ollama service, ensuring correct request formatting and response handling.
Domain Knowledge Acquired
Asynchronous Programming in Python: Gained deeper insights into using asyncio and httpx for non-blocking I/O operations, which is crucial for scalable web applications.
Environment Configuration Management: Learned the importance of using environment variables for configuration, enhancing the application's flexibility and portability.
Error Handling Best Practices: Developed strategies for comprehensive error handling, improving the application's resilience and maintainability.
These actions and insights have contributed to a more robust and flexible implementation of the song-vocab project, particularly in integrating and configuring the ollama service. This progress aligns with the goals of Agentic Workflows by enhancing the application's ability to handle complex workflows and external service interactions efficiently.


Certainly! Here's a summary of the actions taken and the domain knowledge applied to address the issues with the Ollama server and the FastAPI application:
1. Initial Error Identification:
Connection Issues: Identified that the FastAPI application was unable to connect to the Ollama server, resulting in a "Failed to connect to Ollama" error.
404 Error: Noted a "404 Not Found" error when attempting to access the /api/generate endpoint, indicating a potential misconfiguration or incorrect endpoint usage.
2. Troubleshooting Steps:
Docker Configuration: Verified the Docker container setup to ensure the Ollama server was running and correctly mapped to the expected port. This involved checking the docker ps output and ensuring the correct port mapping.
Server Logs Analysis: Analyzed the Ollama server logs to confirm the server's listening port and identify any errors related to endpoint availability.
Endpoint Verification: Confirmed that the correct endpoint for model generation was /api/generate and ensured the application was configured to use this endpoint.
Domain Knowledge Application:
Model Availability: Used knowledge of model naming conventions and server configurations to troubleshoot the "model not found" errors. This involved verifying the correct model names (phi3:mini) and understanding how models are loaded and accessed on the server.
Network Configuration: Applied understanding of network settings and Docker networking to ensure the application could access the server, including testing with curl to verify connectivity.
API Testing: Explained the structure and purpose of API endpoints in the context of testing, highlighting how the /api/get_vocabulary endpoint is defined and used within the application.
Resolution and Recommendations:
Correct Endpoint Usage: Ensured the application was using the correct endpoint and model names, updating the code where necessary.
Testing and Validation: Recommended using tools like curl to manually test server connectivity and endpoint functionality, providing a method to isolate and identify issues.
These actions demonstrate a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving issues, leveraging domain knowledge in Docker, API design, and server configuration to ensure the application functions as intended. If you need further assistance or have additional questions, feel free to ask!

1️⃣ Issue Identification & Initial Troubleshooting
Detected that Ollama was not responding on port 8008 despite appearing to run.
Used curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8008 to check service availability.
Confirmed that the service was not listening on the expected port, leading to further investigation.
2️⃣ System-Level Diagnosis
Ran ps aux | grep ollama and found that Ollama was not running at all.
Used ss -tulnp | grep 8008 to check if anything was listening on the expected port.
Investigated potential issues with Docker (if Ollama was containerized) by checking docker ps | grep ollama.
3️⃣ Network & Resource Constraints Analysis
Tested manual model pull via:
sh
Copy
Edit
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{"model": "phi3:3.8b"}'
Key finding: Connection refused → confirmed that Ollama was not running or crashed.
Checked disk space constraints using df -h, since model pulls require significant storage.
4️⃣ Resolution & Corrective Actions
Restarted Ollama with:
sh
Copy
Edit
ollama serve &
If it failed, ran it in foreground mode (ollama serve) to capture error messages.
If still unsuccessful, reinstalled Ollama using:
sh
Copy
Edit
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
If needed, attempted pulling a smaller model (mistral) to isolate potential memory issues.
5️⃣ Iterative Debugging & Workflow Optimization
Implemented a retry loop that waits for service availability only 5 times before attempting a model pull, cycling back if the pull fails.
Improved resilience in automated workflows by ensuring failures trigger retries rather than an immediate exit.
🔎 Key Learnings in Agentic Workflows
Service Monitoring & Recovery: Used HTTP status checks to determine system state.
Resource Management: Identified the impact of disk space and memory limitations on model pulls.
Automated Error Handling: Implemented a retry mechanism to avoid unnecessary failures.
Debugging Best Practices: Used process monitoring (ps aux), network checks (ss -tulnp), and verbose logs (curl -v).
