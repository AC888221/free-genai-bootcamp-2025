Used ss -tulnp | grep 8008 to check if anything was listening on the expected port.
Investigated potential issues with Docker (if Ollama was containerized) by checking docker ps | grep ollama.
3️⃣ Network & Resource Constraints Analysis
Tested manual model pull via:
sh
Copy
Edit
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{"model": "phi3:3.8b"}'
Key finding: Connection refused → confirmed that Ollama was not running or crashed.
Checked disk space constraints using df -h, since model pulls require significant storage.
4️⃣ Resolution & Corrective Actions

Summary of Actions Taken
Initial Issue Identification:
The initial problem was identified when the vocabulary extraction process was failing during the tests, specifically in the extract_vocabulary function. The logs indicated that the LLM was not returning properly formatted JSON, leading to fallback extraction.
2. Code Modifications:
Error Handling Improvements: We enhanced the error handling in the extract_vocabulary.py file to provide more detailed logging and validation of the LLM's response. This included:
Adding checks for the presence of JSON tags in the response.
Implementing a regex-based extraction method to capture JSON content between [START_JSON] and [END_JSON] tags.
Validating the structure of the JSON response to ensure it contained the expected fields.
Prompt Optimization:
We modified the prompt sent to the LLM to include explicit instructions for formatting the output as JSON, including examples of the expected structure. This aimed to improve the consistency of the LLM's responses.
Testing and Validation:
After implementing the changes, we ran tests to validate the functionality of the vocabulary extraction process. The tests showed that while the fallback extraction was working, the LLM still failed to provide the expected structured output.
5. Domain Knowledge Acquisition:
Throughout the process, we gained insights into:
LLM Response Handling: Understanding how to effectively parse and validate JSON responses from LLMs, including the importance of using delimiters to ensure clean extraction.
Error Logging: The significance of detailed logging for debugging purposes, which helps in identifying issues with LLM responses.
Prompt Engineering: The impact of prompt design on the quality of LLM outputs, emphasizing the need for clear and structured requests to achieve desired results.
6. Next Steps:
We discussed the possibility of further refining the prompt and examining the raw LLM responses to better understand the discrepancies. This would involve checking the actual content returned by the LLM to identify any patterns or issues that could be addressed.

Summary of Actions Taken

Domain Knowledge Applied
Understanding LLM Processing Requirements:
Identified that LLM-based vocabulary extraction requires significantly longer timeouts (increased from 30s to 300s)
Recognized the pattern in error logs indicating timeout issues rather than connection problems
Example: ERROR:__main__:Error type: <class 'httpx.ReadTimeout'> led to implementing specific timeout handling
Streamlit's Asynchronous Limitations:
Discovered that st.experimental_run_async is no longer available in current Streamlit versions
Implemented a custom run_async function using asyncio to properly handle event loops
Example: Created a solution that maintains compatibility with Streamlit's synchronous nature while allowing async API calls
API Integration Patterns:
Analyzed backend logs to understand the expected request format
Identified that the backend expects specific JSON structures for different endpoints
Example: Formatted requests with {"message_request": song_name} for lyrics search and {"text": text} for vocabulary extraction
User Experience for AI-Powered Applications:
Recognized the need for clear user expectations when working with LLM-based tools
Implemented informative messages about processing times
Example: Added notices like "Processing may take up to 5 minutes as the AI analyzes the lyrics"
Technical Challenges Overcome
Timeout Issues:
Problem: Initial requests to the backend were timing out
Solution: Increased timeout settings and added specific error handling for timeout exceptions
Result: Successfully processed longer texts without timeouts
Asynchronous Execution in Streamlit:
Problem: Streamlit's synchronous nature conflicted with async API calls
Solution: Implemented a custom asyncio wrapper to handle event loops properly
Result: Maintained responsive UI while performing long-running backend operations
