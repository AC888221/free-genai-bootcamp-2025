Here's a summary of our Agentic Workflow progress with the Song Vocabulary project:

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created proper directory structure following Python best practices
   - Set up necessary directories: prompts/, tools/, outputs/, bin/, tests/
   - Added `.gitignore` and `.gitkeep` files
   - Organized test files into dedicated tests/ directory

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Created and refined requirements.txt
   - Resolved dependency conflicts
   - Removed unnecessary sqlite3 requirement (as it's part of standard library)
   - Relaxed version constraints while maintaining compatibility

3. **Application Setup**
   - Confirmed FastAPI backend is running on http://localhost:8000
   - Identified deprecation warning in main.py and provided solution using new lifespan handlers
   - Verified API endpoints are accessible via:
     - Swagger UI (/docs)
     - ReDoc (/redoc)

4. **Running Scripts**
   - Set up run.sh for application startup
   - Added run_tests.sh for testing
   - Provided instructions for making scripts executable
   - Explained different ways to run the application

5. **Interaction Methods**
   - Explained available methods to interact with the API:
     - Swagger UI interface
     - cURL commands
     - Python requests
   - Noted that this is currently a backend-only implementation

6. **Next Steps Could Include**:
   - Implementing the frontend interface
   - Adding more robust error handling
   - Implementing caching for searched songs
   - Expanding language model support beyond Phi4-mini

The project follows an Agentic Workflow by breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and providing clear documentation for each component.

Current Status
We are still in the planning phase, having:
✅ Identified appropriate model
✅ Confirmed hardware compatibility
✅ Established system requirements


Tested the /api/get_vocabulary endpoint:

We provided Chinese text to extract vocabulary words.
Initially, we encountered a JSON decode error due to incorrect formatting.
We corrected the JSON format by removing line breaks and ensuring the text was properly enclosed in double quotes.
After fixing the format, the request was successful, and we received a list of vocabulary words.
Tested the /api/agent endpoint:

We provided a song name and artist to retrieve the lyrics.
Initially, we encountered a "Field required" error because the message_request field was missing.
We added the message_request field and formatted it correctly as a string.
After fixing the format, we encountered an "Internal Server Error" due to a connection issue with Ollama.
We provided instructions to ensure Ollama is installed and running.
We added cURL commands to test the endpoints from the command line.
