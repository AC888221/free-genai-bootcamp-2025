Project: Quality Assurance and Test Coverage

Difficulty: Level 200

Business Goal: 
Now that the prototype web-application is working, the fractional CTO wants to provide assurance to key stakeholders that the application is working as expected.

You have been tasked to do two things:
Use an AI coding assistant or LLMs to audit and improve, refactor your codebase.
Implement Unit Tests and try to aim for at least 70% coverage

Please write up a summary of your findings for the fractional CTO to review.

Technical Considerations

Use AI coding assistants or specialized AI code coverage tools:
Qodo coverage  â€” open-source tools can be used to rapidly write Unit Tests
Windsurf
Cursor
Amazon Developer Q
Github Copilot
