Project: Frontend — Lang Portal

Difficulty: Level 200

Business Goal: 
A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as three things:
Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
Act as a record store, providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps

You have been tasked with creating the frontend API of the application.
The fractional CTO has made strong recommendation that you settle on a frontend stack that is being commonly adopted and optimized for AI prototyping services.

The frontend application should powered by your backend API.


Technical Restrictions:
The technical stack should be the following:
Typescript (statically typed javascript)
Tailwind CSS (css framework)
Vite.js (frontend tool)
ShadCN (UI components)

Leverage an AI prototyping service to write your frontend code:
Lovable.dev
Bolt.new
v0.dev

Leverage AI-coding assistants as a secondary AI service to write your frontend code:
Cursor
Windsurf Codeium
Github Copilot
Amazon Q Developer
Google Code Assist
